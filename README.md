# PostgreSQL Icecream Database

In this project, I design a database of icecream with dietary requirements.

I decided to create this project to practice PostgreSQL, Database design, and SQL Querying.

I chose Icecream because is a topic I find enjoyable (also inspired by Two Scoops Django book), and because the dietary requirements allow me to have all three types of relationships in one small project: **many-to-many** for the icecreams that comply with different dietary requirements, **one-to-many** for the reviews done to each icecream flavour, and **one-to-one** for the address of each icecream shop.

I use as a guide [flavours listed in Messina's website](./media/inspiration.jpg), though the information I will fill the database with will be fictitious.
